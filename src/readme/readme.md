<!-- Overview: -->
This project primarily focused the use React to create a ToDo List that is interactive.
My project has three main tabs that display different pages.
Home Tab : displays a table of  your todo list and items on it (also description,completed and an option to adjust it)
Add New: displays a page where you can add new ToDos and it will be logged on the homepage
Contact: display a page where you can submit your feedback using first name,last name and email.

<!-- Technologies Used -->
-react
-redux
-google fonts
-bootstrap
-github
-js
-css

<!-- Ideas for Improvement  -->
-work on css and react together for better/easier styling
- homepage not be blank when intially pulled up on web page
- once task is completed be able to highlight it so it stands out as completed not just the word completed
- added a timer to complete task (or alarm to remind)
